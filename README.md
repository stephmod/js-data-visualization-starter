# JS Data Visualization Starter

This starter is my template for the custom data visualization experiences I create using JavaScript's Vue framework, D3 graphics library, and GSAP animation library. This stack makes device responsiveness, user interactivity, and data reactivity simple and enjoyable.

Extensions of the starter component range from simple charts (bar, line, area) to more complex implementations, such as tree layouts, force simulations, and custom visuals. Depending on the project, elements are added and/or removed. Elements are further modified based on the format of a given dataset.
